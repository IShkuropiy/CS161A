// ------------- DESIGN -------------
/* 
Program Name: Grade Calculator

Program Description: This program calculates studentâ€™s final grade based on assignment scores, 
// midterm exam, and a final exam. The assignments count for 60% of the grade, and the midterm and final exam 20% each.
// Then the program outputs both the final numeric score and the letter grade.

Design:
A. INPUT
numAssigns as int
score as double
midterm as double
finalExam as double

B. OUTPUT
finalScore as double
assignAvg as double

C. CALCULATIONS
finalScore = assignAvg * ASSIGN_PERCENT + midterm * MIDTERM_PERCENT + finalExam * FINAL_PERCENT;
assignAvg = sum / numAssigns;

D. LOGIC and ALGORITHMS
    WELCOME
    READ 
    SET sum = 0
    FOR each assignment
        READ score
        ADD score to sum
    END FOR
    CALCULATE assignAvg = sum / numAssigns
    IF numAssigns = 0 THEN assignAvg = 0
    READ midterm
    READ finalExam
    CALCULATE finalScore = (assignAvg * 0.6) + (midterm * 0.2) + (finalExam * 0.2)
    DETERMINE letter grade:
        IF score >= 3.5 THEN grade = 'A'
        ELSE IF score >= 2.5 THEN grade = 'B'
        ELSE IF score >= 1.5 THEN grade = 'C'
        ELSE IF score >= 1.0 THEN grade = 'D'
        ELSE grade = 'F'

    DISPLAY finalScore 
    DISPLAY letter grade
    GOODBYE
